                        Is burning your money on our wonderful products not enough? Wish you could get rid of it faster?
                        You can!

                        We could really use the money, all the advertising and PR for our totally legit business is
                        expensive,
                        and our executives can barely afford their golden toilets for their Hawaiian vacation homes. You
                        don't want to
                        take the golden spoon out of the mouths of our VPs would you? Consider donating your money to
                        support
                        them and their families.

                        We here at Nothing but Nothing have worked very hard to deliver the very best in products.
                        As such, we are very excited to announce our brand new product, the Nothing! </p>
                    <p>
                        We won the lawsuit! As long as we send you a piece of paper, you cannot refund your
                        purchase! Thanks to all of you for standing behind us and supporting us through this dark time.
                        This is an excellent step towards a better Nothing filled world.
