                    <h2>Our story</h2>
                    <p>
                        Nothing but Nothing was founded with one belief - The best things in life are free. So we
                        set
                        out on a journey to find exactly what people want. Surprisingly we found people like to
                        spend
                        money, but sadly they never actually have anything to spend their money on. So we ditched out
                        previous belief
                        and
                        changed it to - The best things in life are the ones you don't own. Voila, we had a company!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The next question was what as a company would we sell? It was at that moment that someone in
                        the
                        board meeting finished their cup of coffee. "I guess the glass is all empty," someone from
                        the
                        opposite side of the table chortled. Urika! We had our product. It was so simple, we could
                        sell
                        people the lack of something! Excitedly, we all picked up our pens and began jotting down ideas
                        for
                        future products; Products like, the bottle of nothing, or our personal favorite, box of
                        nothing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ten minutes after that faithful day and our company has been a long time success. We went from a
                        company that
                        only sold two items of nothing, to a company with a repertoire of 5 completely original and
                        unique
                        products. It is our humble belief that for many years people
                        will
                        be buying the one thing they do not presently have: Nothing!
